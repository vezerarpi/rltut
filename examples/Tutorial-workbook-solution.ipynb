    "After a certain number of episodes you can use the `CartPoleModel.print_eval` method to print the Q values form the model for 7 pole angles between +/-10 degrees. These Q values should increase over time as your model experiences longer episodes , and thus more rewards, when it chooses actions that help stabilise the pole. If your values are not changing from one iteration to the next then there may be a problem with the chainer code that is stopping gradient updates s from being applied back through the components of the model. These outputs are only a rough indicator of how well your model is doing. It is unlikely to ever see exactly these states so it may not have made the best decision for each of them, but if the rewards are not increasing and the Q values do not look like they are moving towards values that you would expect given the pole orientation then something is probably wrong."
